### ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

#### 5. Webhook Integrations
- **Status:** Infrastructure exists, user features missing
- **What Works:**
  - Database models: `WebhookDestination`, `WebhookDelivery`, `WebhookEvent`
  - Schema supports URL, secret (HMAC), event filtering, delivery tracking
  - Stripe webhooks fully functional
  - Admin monitoring of webhook events
- **What's Missing:**
  - No API endpoints for users to configure webhooks
  - No delivery/retry logic for user webhooks
  - No user-facing UI for webhook management
  - No event dispatch system for alerts
- **Gap Impact:** Professional and Enterprise plans promise "Webhook integrations" but users cannot actually set them up

#### 6. Mobile App Access
- **Status:** Responsive web only, no native app
- **What Works:**
  - Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
  - Mobile-optimized layouts
  - Phone verification UI in settings
- **What's Missing:**
  - No native iOS app
  - No native Android app
  - No mobile-specific features (push notifications, offline mode)
- **Gap Impact:** Plans promise "Mobile app access" but it's just a responsive website

#### 7. Multi-Location Support
- **Status:** Database ready, feature incomplete
- **What Works:**
  - `Business` model has location fields (latitude, longitude, radius)
  - Location input during onboarding
  - Geolocation data stored
- **What's Missing:**
  - Users can only have ONE business (not multiple locations)
  - No geographic filtering or radius-based monitoring
  - No location-specific competitor tracking
- **Gap Impact:** Enterprise plan promises "Multi-location support" but limited to single location

---

### 📝 INFRASTRUCTURE ONLY

#### 8. Analytics & Reporting
- **Status:** Data collection complete, no visualization
- **What Works:**
  - All price changes, promotions, alerts logged
  - Admin stats API shows basic metrics
  - Alert system tracks change types
  - Historical data available
- **What's Missing:**
  - No charts or graphs
  - No trend analysis
  - No competitive reports
  - No dashboard visualizations
  - No weekly/monthly summary reports
- **Gap Impact:** Professional plan promises "Advanced price analytics" and "Weekly competitive reports" - neither exist

---

### ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED

#### 9. SMS Alerts
- **Status:** No sending capability
- **What Exists:**
  - `SmsQueue` database table
  - `NotificationPreferences` schema with SMS fields
  - Phone verification UI placeholders
- **What's Missing:**
  - No SMS provider integration (Twilio, AWS SNS, etc.)
  - No sending logic
  - No rate limiting or cost tracking
- **Gap Impact:** Professional plan includes "Email + SMS alerts" for $99/mo but SMS doesn't work
- **Blocker:** Critical for Professional and Enterprise plans

#### 10. Data Export (CSV)

  - Well-structured data models
- **What's Missing:**
  - No API key generation system
  - No public API documentation
  - No rate limiting for API calls

#### 12. Custom Alert Rules & Triggers
- **Status:** Fixed alert types only
- **What Exists:**
  - Three alert types: price_change, new_promotion, menu_change
  - Enable/disable per alert type
- **What's Missing:**
  - No custom threshold rules (e.g., "alert if price > $50")

## Technical Debt & Quality Issues

### Good Architecture Decisions
- Queue-based processing for scalability
- Proper database schema with indexes
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Cron job infrastructure with secret protection
- AI-powered extraction (future-proof)

### Areas for Improvement
- **No plan enforcement in code** - Features rely on UI hiding, not backend validation
- **Missing rate limiting** - No request throttling on APIs
- **No data retention cleanup** - Snapshots accumulate indefinitely
- **Limited error monitoring** - No centralized error tracking (consider Sentry)
- **No feature flags** - Can't enable/disable features per plan programmatically

---

## Recommendations for Product Launch

### Option 1: Honest Pricing (Recommended)
**Update pricing page to reflect current capabilities:**

- **Starter ($49/mo):** "Everything you need for basic monitoring"
  - Remove: "Mobile app access" → Change to "Mobile-optimized web interface"
  - Keep all other features (all working)

- **Professional ($99/mo → $79/mo):** "Advanced monitoring for growing businesses"
  - Remove: SMS alerts, Webhook integrations, CSV export, Analytics, Reports
  - Keep: Email alerts, 20 competitors, 90-day history
  - **Lower price to $79/mo** until features complete

- **Enterprise ($299/mo → $149/mo):** "For serious competitors"
  - Remove: API access, Custom rules, Multi-location, SMS, Webhooks
  - Keep: Unlimited competitors, unlimited history, priority support
  - **Lower price to $149/mo** until features complete

**Benefits:**
- Honest marketing builds trust
- Prevents customer churn from unmet expectations
- Avoids refund requests
- Creates upgrade path when features ship

### Option 2: Feature Roadmap Transparency
Keep current pricing but add:
- "Coming Soon" badges on unimplemented features
- Public roadmap with ETA for each feature
- Discount code for early adopters who pay now

### Option 3: Freemium Launch
- Keep Starter plan at $49 (fully functional)
- Launch Pro/Enterprise as "Waitlist" tiers
- Build MVP with paying customers before charging enterprise rates

## Conclusion

**Current State:**
- Solid foundation with 33% of promised features fully working
- Excellent infrastructure for scaling
- Critical gaps in revenue-generating features (SMS, Webhooks, API)

**Recommendations:**
1. **Do not charge $99+ until blockers resolved** - Risk of customer complaints
2. **Focus on Phase 1 (2-3 weeks)** - Makes Professional plan viable
3. **Defer Enterprise features** until Professional is proven
4. **Update pricing page** to reflect reality
5. **Consider soft launch** with limited beta users

**Estimated Time to Feature Parity:**
- Professional Plan: 2-3 weeks (Phase 1)
- Enterprise Plan: 4-6 weeks (Phase 1 + Phase 2)
- Full Feature Set: 8-10 weeks (All phases)

This is a **strong MVP** with core monitoring working well. The gaps are in advanced features that can be built incrementally while serving early customers with the working Starter plan.
